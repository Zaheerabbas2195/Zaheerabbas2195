<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Zaheer Abbas </h1>
<h4 align="left">I am a highly skilled GIS & Earth Observation Engineer with extensive experience in geospatial data analysis, network design, and remote sensing. With a strong foundation in GIS software, spatial databases, and Python scripting for automation, I have successfully contributed to projects in urban planning, environmental conservation, and fiber network design.

Throughout my career, I have been key in planning and optimizing FTTx networks, developing geospatial databases, and integrating GIS solutions into field operations to enhance efficiency and data accuracy. My expertise spans spatial-temporal analysis, georeferencing, cartography, and web mapping, making me a valuable asset in data-driven decision-making.

Passionate about the intersection of geospatial technology and artificial intelligence, I explore AI-driven analytics to enhance spatial data processing, predictive modeling, and automation in GIS applications. My bachelor's research and project work includes deep learning-based feature extraction from satellite imagery and socioeconomic parameter estimation, demonstrating my ability to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to geospatial challenges.

With an MSc in Project Planning and Management from the University of Bradford and a BSc in Geo-Informatics, I combine technical expertise with project management skills. I am committed to leveraging geospatial AI and innovative GIS solutions to solve complex real-world problems within forward-thinking organizations.
